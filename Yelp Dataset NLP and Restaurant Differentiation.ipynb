later seating   after reading the mixed reviews of late i was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department we started with the fried dough burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely then although they dont offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them we chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon asparagus and grana frita both were very good we split a secondi which was the special berkshire pork secreto which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pure and romanesco broccoli incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not   management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert we ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty portions are not huge which i particularly like because i prefer to order courses if you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite dining room was mostly younger crowd while the

sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked   we ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes the potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected for 35

burger with caramelized onions a red wine sauce and i believe blue cheese the first time it was excellent and just the right size for me i hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that i cant even finish half of flips burgers are about the same size i would make for myself at home  the second time i went i had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie and a very sweet syrupy sauce which i could have done without but overall it was very good i also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings ive had ever  the only thing i dont really like about flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables i guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever but it makes me feel as if i am in a school cafeteria back in high school i dont like it there are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from ikea its also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound like a school cafeteria  the last time i was in there there were a couple of women with small children i have no idea why someone would bring a child to flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater they dont make anything plain everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients its also very pricy for burgers this is the last place on earth i would bring kids to eat burger king is right down the streeteating healthy i had the turkey burger it was great no fries and water w lemon jacklimeteam had a great time anchorman2reviewendthe only problem with flip burger boutique is that richard blais isnt cooking your burger  i have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen flip burger would be 5 stars  you are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper which isnt quite going to cut it  we started off with the poutine appetizer  poutine is popping up everywhere lately  this version was underwhelming  there really wasnt any meat in this dish  the fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based but i couldnt find much chorizo in it  it should also have cheese curds but those were absent as well  what we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries topped with two fried eggs  unfortunately the egg whites were still runny which im not a fan of  its amazing that its so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked  there was plenty of fries so my buddy and i kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white  2 stars  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosflipburgerboutiqueatlantaselectnxzcvqqueaxzwfcwmhzxq  i was very excited to try a milkshake here specifically the krispy kreme shake  i dont know if they blend up an whole krispy kreme glazed donut in there but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one  it was delicious  my only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen  of course if youve watched richard blais on top chef you know he enjoys using it  so these shakes have liquid nitrogen added to them  unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server hostess  it consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake which made it smoke a little bit  this cant be what blais intends here as it added nothing but a little flair  ive had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and its usually used to get a crunchy outer shell which would have offered an interesting texture  it also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals thus giving it a smoother texture  this was a pretty smooth creamy shake so perhaps thats whats going on here  the top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess  4 stars  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosflipburgerboutiqueatlantaselectv7xgreyovbkije2xldxg  as for the burger i went with the earth  turf burger  this patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms and i loved the blend  it was topped with caramelized onions sauted mushrooms gruyere cheese pickles and a delicious mushroom mayo  lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo  if you love mushrooms this is your burger  i ordered it medium rare  from the first bite i thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding  unfortunately the burger flipper didnt give me a medium rare burger or even a medium burger  it was closer to medium well and fully cooked all the way through  now the quality of the beef saved it  it was still very juicy and i enjoyed every bite  however the burger flippers job is to do one thing and thats pretty much cook a burger correctly  a real chef wouldnt have messed that up  even still im giving this burger 45 stars  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosflipburgerboutiqueatlantaselectyavwdoolsy8ksvs4lanhq  my buddy also enjoyed his burger but it was also medium well rather than the medium rare he ordered  we were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to so its not like he lost track of them  oh well thats the problem with a chain style restaurant where the top chef is absent  and lack of execution keeps flip burger from getting 5 stars from me  but ill be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime  also of note they say they are open until 11pm but we were turned away at 1045 pm which we werent too happy about  if you dont want to take customers up until your closing time then change your closing time to when you do want to take them  1030 or whatever  but to turn someone away while you are technically still open only ticks off the customer  we almost didnt return the next day

really like at all so i was probably getting myself into a grosslytempting land of foodiness given all the other things i know or think sound goody good on their menu i went anywayi wanted the company and im so used to dining out i couldnt resist i suppose  long story short the service was capitalb bad bad slow inattentive as lauren s noted no refills on water plus other drinks were slow and things like james hs grits side and emily rs fries were either forgotten the former or delayed and without steak sauce the latter then the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together had to ask for it to be corrected    only to find that each one had a 20 service charge tacked on huh we all sat in the bar area the group just kinda grew as people filtered in and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an autoadd for big parties besides i thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least oftenenough to have talked with ron and be a pretty familiar face  and were yelpers so were gonna tip you oh and ps not everyone ordered the 5 special like kathleen m with her shrimpngrits or lauren s with her breakfast bowl    no one was gonna stiff them  still our first three dining companions left without much fanfare and i figured hey bad night then    the rest of us got ready to leave and a our server took forfreakinever to bring checks and b the last straw in my book dropped emily rs togo box on the floor picked it up and resealed it and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened oh did i mention that while we were waiting on our checks we got to see several other servers note not ours eating some of rons wings at the bar with regulars as he later described them yeah it was a bad night at rosebud  so when our server finally came back with the checks i spoke up my intention was to let him know that we were nonplussed and as i stated to him he should remove the automatic 20 service charge if hed included it a couple minutes later ron came out to chat  i have to say    im a little bit embarrassed because im not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason or really ever unless its a gracious gesture on managements part and when ron came over it felt well like our server had tattled to daddy    and that ron didnt really want to hear what had happened he said most of the right things and agreed with comments but suddenly i felt like i was the only one speaking up he didnt really care he noted hed worked 80 or 90 hours in the last week ok but youre the owner right the resto business is nothing close to easy    what does that have to do with our conversation and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge    and then he said i can see where this is going    let me just take care of all of your dinners  well sht not really what i wanted to have happen honestly it just seemed like an easy out to get me us to sthu and then    how do i tip on a nondinner especially one where i just had bloody marys once noting how sloooow everyones food orders came despite being tempted and do i just take it as a freebie given my week of eat on 30 challengedom it was all too much it seemed we all left awkwardly not to mention that kathleen james and lauren had to pay including a service charge and we didnt and while emily tipped for me since i didnt eat but she knew i felt weird i left with the overall thought    huh what just happened  monday i will chalk it all up to monday i really like rosebud and want to

what i ordered since we were there for lunch the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for 8 you could get a burrito chips and a drink sounded like a pretty good deal so i got it this is where i hand it to them i assumed that all the extra toppings cost well extra but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu i saw online i then found out that they arent so i also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito i didnt want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge my friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his  there were a couple of minor things that bothered me after ordering at the counter i wasnt sure if i was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out

his tradein so the numbers didnt work which means he couldnt get the car well when we told beaverton toyota about it they went over to that subaru lot bought the car brought it back to their lot gave

wanted to look at my options we took the car i wanted for a test drive and i absolutely loved it the car felt planted even on wet surfaces the route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and

getting the massage in the first place i tried the introductory massage for ninety minutes had this been a good massage i would have been happy i would have been ecstatic but within minutes of my 90

areas i had requested instead my therapist decided to give me the massage he wanted to give during my session i repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on mainly my arms hands legs and feet this was a very looonnnggg massagewhich usually is a good thing but in this case just proved to be frustrating i couldnt wait for it to be over i literally ran out

appeared to be unevenly baked with the bottom half looking undercooked the pink lemonade cake was hard and dry ive never put a cupcake down before without finishing it but for the first time i did   this is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting these bakers could learn a lot from the cupcake shops in dc and new yorkgreat atmosphere and packaging but the cupcake tasted really bad and the frosting even worse  i was very excited to try sweet after it opened and the very cute atmosphere gave me hope that i would be in for a treat  i got my cupcakes to go and i was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging  however when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes i was sorely disappointed  the cake was dry really really dry  stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper

conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours the online system confirmed that i would be charged a 15 fee  however the schedule change did not take effect they showed up when i was not home and my whole payment was wasted  customer service told me nothing was rescheduledthey dont know why the system did not register itno compensation offered  the 3rd cleaning the pro omar started by texting that he was running late  then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the t and his words  the situation is a lil risky for me    i called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming  they told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a 35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him    the

scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isnt right on top of each other i also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room my boyfriend is a smoker and he didnt mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed   the rooms are a bit small but it was only two of us so it wasnt cramped and we were in the room so little it didnt matter

first visit since flip burger opened the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating two large booths on either end of the restaurant i had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of hd1s mainstays on the menu but unfortunately only the haute dog made it   no biggie the bf and i both decided on burger options he had the oaxaca burger  beef patty topped with sliced avocado pico de gallo and smoked mayo i was a litle hesitant trying it   it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds  but the spice was surprisingly mild good news for me but bad news if youre looking for some kick the burger itself was wellcooked very tender and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef  i chose their special of the day the surf and turf burger beef patty topped with sauteed lobster knuckles garlic herb white wine butter pea shoots and green goddess dressing which came with a side of seasoned fries  served with mayo and ketchup 16 the adjectives were just too much for me to resist i had to have it i wasnt disappointed it was quite tasty it was the same beef patty of the oaxaca  the lobster was buttery and well cooked also more

day before the appointment so unfortunately i forgot about it  when i called to reschedule i apologized several times and her attitude was still not so pleasant she said you cannot reschedule until you pay us the 50 cancellation fee it says that on the website i dont know where but you can go find it you dont know where because you never told mepossibly anyone about it 50 was even more expensive than the groupon deal i paid for  so i said when there is a cancellation policy my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment she said well we do it two days before no she did not do that either so i found another dentist they told me about their cancellation policy the first time i called then they called me to remind me two days before the appointment

his name seems to escape me now so please forgive me i know i should have memorized his name since i am so impressed and all but i am the worst for names anywho this guy did show me that even with his
